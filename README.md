# Squirrel

Squirrel is a kind of lovely animal, it's vivid and wise. While autumn is coming to go, the squirrel will explore and nut hard, hide fruits in safe cave. A nut is small but stored amount is large. In cold and long winter, the squirrel eats nuts and gets alive.

Quant is a financial trader and developer who composites policy and intelligence into computers, which run and trade automatically. One trade gets only a few profit, but many trades make a lot. Like diligent squirrel's autumn-harvest, quant's computers work tirelessly for more profits.

I have developed a quantitative trading software, named as Flixible Trading System(FTS), which buy and sell international gold--AUXUSD. The FTS was written by MQL5 language which grammar likes C++, and run on MT5 platform. I decide to contribute it to community of open source, and GitHub supplies shared store and version controlling. So, I will deposit part of FTS on GitHub, which repository named as Squirrel. Why Squirrel? The openning of the text gives first explanation, but a simple, imaged name is more favourite.
